You are being asked to complete a survey that will take approximately 15 minutes.
The researchers are interested in seeing how many people know and don’t know various things about politics, government policies, and government.  The data collected will be stored at a secure location, and no identifying information about you will be shared or made public.  The results will be presented in scholarly journals and/or at academic conferences, in the form of statistical summaries, describing how many people, not who, said what.


Your participation is voluntary.  You will receive $0.75 for completing the survey, paid through Amazon Mechanical Turk.  There are no known risks associated with participating in this study.  Doing so will not benefit you personally beyond the $0.75, but the research is likely to add to scientific knowledge.


To be eligible to participate, you must be at least 18 years old and be a U.S. citizen.  If you have any questions, please contact Gaurav Sood at gsood07 (at) gmail (dot) com.

Illegal immigrants are pouring over the border, and he intends to flush them back out of the US and prevent more from coming. This has caused the start of a wall to be built across the border spanning the south of the US in connection with South America. The budget for this issue is extreme, and cuts have been made from our National Parks (I'm protesting currently on that, as I am an avid backcountry backpacker in the National Parks around the US), environmental services, and more.

The other issue with immigration has mainly to do with Muslim-esque peoples. Trump wants to keep on the ""extremists."" A lot of these people are trying to FLEE the extremists as they are discriminated against and seeking asylum in the US.

The immigration process is extensive and costly, so it is no wonder why there are illegal immigrants. It took my husband three years to finally be approved and allowed to move here (he is British). It cost us more than $5,000, and it is will cost us another $600 this year to renew is green card. Most people moving here and starting brand new can' afford that! Also, when you finally get your VISA to get here, you can't even work till they give you a ssn! Then the ssn still doesn't let you work until you obtain a Work Visa! That takes weeks! By this time, most people would have nothing left if his/her partner did not financially support them through the process and drive them everywhere, cause GUESS WHAT! You need a snn, address papers, bills statements, and more to prove you live in the US, and HOW are you going to pay a bill in your name after all the expenses it took to get here and also all the expenses to stay alive here for a month while you CAN'T work legally and CAN'T get a job, as you aren't allowed to apply until AFTER all the paperwork and approvals and fingerprinting procedures are sorted completely.",0.809,442.086,443.747,17,"Trump, as well as a lot of Republicans, seem to believe that climate change is not a thing. It is false, apparently. Climate change is a real concern. As the average world temperatures rise, we see the changes even now. More mild winters followed by hail, rain, and storm systems. We have experienced so many hail storms where I live, more than the history of the city.

Climate change is said to be brought around by human activities in driving, food production, and other carbon emissions. These emissions cause trappings in the atmosphere, and heat up the globe. Ice caps are melting. Scientists thought perhaps not enough volcanoes were emitting ash into the atmosphere (causes cooling), however, those volcanoes that have been active have not necessarily lessened their activities. 

Newer studies are showing that food production linked with pigs, cows, and other meats lead to a lot of the emissions, as these animals let out methane. Also the procedures to create grain and food for the animals releases emissions, milling and sorting the food for the animals releases emissions, transporting the food, feeding the animals, the animals living in a facility/factory, machinery operation there, butchering animals, packaging, transportation, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,15.185,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.485,45.133,54.105,5,Don’t know,Damaging the ozone layer,Don’t know,,15.423,16.583,24.172,3,Reduced by trees and other plants,"It makes sense, in view of other things I know",12.525,16.312,20.609,3,"Subject immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to deportation ","It makes sense, in view of other things I know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992,Female,Four year college graduate,No,"White,Asian",,,,,,,10.997,10.997,15.292,1,Decreased,"It makes sense, in view of other things I know",,,,,,,5.076,5.076,5.973,1,Remained about the same,I just thought I’d take a shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.577,72.932,73.69,23,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,,,,,,,6.092,21.564,23.272,3,3,10,Both parties are equally good or bad at that,2.732,11.376,12.441,3,Democrat,,3,United States,KY,42211,Cadiz,3/27/2017,US,311551911,cheat,photo,closed,text,closed,asses

1 - Legal immigration through various visas.  These are people who legally apply for a visa based on work, student, marriage, etc. Some background checks are done and immigrants are then allowed into the country and may or may not apply for citizenship.  Once approved (a lengthy and often expensive process) they can stay in the country and should have the same rights as any US citizen.
2 - Immigration through refugee status.  The most relevant example is refugees from Syria.  People whose life and well being is in jeopardy due to war conditions in their home country.  The background checks for these individuals is extremely lengthy and can take up to two years.  This is a highly debated topic in the US.
3 - Illegal immigration is the third type.  These are people who cross the border illegally or who stay beyond a legal visa.  These individuals may be willing to pay taxes and be contibutors to society, but the process to become legal is extremely difficult and individuals risk deportation by starting the process.  Children born to illegal immigrants are another factor as well.  The only country they know is the US so being deported would drastically impact their lives.

There is talk about immigrants 'stealing jobs' and bringing crime, a lot of focus on Mexico. But from what I've researched myself, immigration is generally good for the economy. Even on illegal immigration, most economic analyses show it having a net positive impact on the economy as a whole because it provides cheap labor. The jobs that these immigrants take up are generally low-paying and labor-intensive; agriculture in particular suffers when illegal immigration is stifled.
Many industries rely on legal immigration as well. Medicine and technology come to mind as two big industries.
Immigration from Mexico is at an all time low. A couple of years ago there were more Mexicans leaving the US than arriving.

The result is that sunlight enters the atmosphere but the heat from it cannot be radiated back into space, causing the planet to warm.
Scientific consensus says that climate change is happening and being caused by humans. Recently saw a study that suggested somewhere between 50-80% of climate warming is caused by humans, the rest being due to natural climate cycles. In the next hundred years or so, some major US cities (Miami and New Orleans probably) will start to become unlivable as the seas rise. Weather events of all stripes will become more sever and erratic.

That there is a legal process that needs to be taken before a person can be considered a legal immigrant, and that those that dont follow that process are considered illegal immigrants.  Right now in the U.S. there is much discussion about how to solve our illegal immigrant problem, which some define as too many illegal immigrants in our country.  Trump wants to build a wall to keep them out.  Many, like me, think he is a fool if he thinks this will solve the problem and I think it breaks the heart of America.  He also wants to ignore agreements that we made about citizenship under the Obama administration as if we dont need to be held good to our word.   Many people think illegal immigrants are taking our jobs, but there isnt any real proof that they are taking jobs that legal citizens want to work.  The problem seems to be more  related to not holding employers accountable for verifying legal immigration before hiring.   Many believe employers dont do that so they dont have to pay a fair wage to these illegal immigrants.  Many people are scared that terrorists will infiltrate our country through both the legal and illegal immigrants process.  Trump believes all Muslims need additional vetting before being aloud into our country.  This may be true for some Muslim countries but the way he wanted to do it was illegal and actually not in the true spirit of America.   ",12.169,322.092,556.671,14,"Im assuming you are talking particularly about global warming.  Climate is changing all the time, but the current big topic is whether our world is experience global warming and whether or not human activity is causing it.  Global warming is believed to occur, at least in part, because of the green house effect,  where gases produced by man are causing warm air to be trapped nearer the earth.   Everything from our farming practices and what we grow, to our industry and the pollution we produce contributes to this greenhouse effect.  Global warming could ultimately change everything about our world.   Water resources, food resources, energy resource use.  I think that overall it is believed that the richest(financially) countries product the most greenhouse effect.  There is much argument about whether climate change is a natural process or not, and many people dont like regulations that hinder the way industry produces their goods and want to deregulate a lot of activities that are already regulated.  They dont want additional regulations either.  Many people that believe global warming to be true believe that left unchecked, big industry will pollute our world more and inhibit innovated ways to address the problems that Americans face .   They are also willing to pay extra for more efficient cars and cleaner air, where those that dont want regulations dont want to pay the higher price for companies to be held accountable.

I know that new influxes of immigrants are met with the same irrational fears and hate, no matter what country was their country of origin. During the potatoe famines in Ireland it was the Irish.

It was anyone who looked Hispanic because of numerous reasons, one of which was the embargo on Cuba, in which Castro expelled a large amount of Cubans, making people (more) aware of border crossings in Mexico. Now it is anyone Arab or Muslim or anyone who looks vaguely Middle Eastern because of 9/11.

However, some of our greatest inventions, contributions, artists, and sports players have come from different countries and have chosen to call America home.

Trump recently tried to go back on promises made to people such as translators in the Middle East who burned bridges with the locals in order to provide much needed intell for our troops in exchange for citizenship and protection of our country, hiding behind the fear of the possibility of ""letting in terrorists"". However, the majority of terrorist acts are not only committed by white male American born citizens, but the majority of terrorists that committed 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia, a country that Trump did business with frequently prior to being the president , and a country that was not on his infamous ""ban list"" that stated that people on this list could not gain entry to the United States almost immediately following his inaugeration.

The current perception is based on the unfortunate knowledge that carbon dioxide is a notable greenhouse gas.

That means that the 100 ppm or so increase since the industrial revolution accounts for about 1% with barely any left to accumulate.

People want to apply a carbon tax to ""correct"" this as a sort of compromise between the false dichotomy of absolute dictatorial control of emissions and letting people do whatever they want while the government protects them from liability. Further, failure to understand the economic calculation problem means that they won't understand that they will necessarily be wrong.
