* Study 2 framing

** Order
2. All confidence coding into one thing and add at the end as bridge between studies
3. Study 2 to appendix
4. Nuke it
1. We replicated one of the condition


1) conceptually it is about question design, sth where the partisan cues are part of it (is it introduced or not, neutral info, dk)

2) how do we score the responses (e.g. CCD)

** Todo

- let's redo front, remove CCD. other conditions are about q design, CCD is about scoring
- Lucas: take out CCD, redo tables and graphs, combine studies for new backend result, new table/graph for that as well
