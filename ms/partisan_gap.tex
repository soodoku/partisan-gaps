\begin{abstract}

\noindent Conventional wisdom suggests large, persistent gaps between partisans' stores of political knowledge, fanning concerns about democratic accountability. We reconsider the frequency and size of these ``partisan knowledge gaps,'' . Our findings suggest that knowledge gaps---when they do exist---stem more from motivated responding than genuine differences in factual knowledge.

Factual knowledge about politics has long been viewed by scholars as key to democratic competence. Higher levels of political knowledge correspond to a number of normatively desirable outcomes, including higher levels of political tolerance and support for democratic norms, more active participation in politics, and more stable and consistent opinions on political matters \citep{Converse1964,dellicarpini,galston_2001}. Political knowledge also helps facilitate connections between individual group identities and policy views, which can then be applied to evaluations of public officials and parties in a way that increases democratic accountability \citep{dellicarpini}.

Political knowledge's centrality to democratic health is perhaps why so many are troubled by the fact that Democrats and Republicans appear to differ in their knowledge of politics. Partisans' biased interpretation and retention of political facts appears in public opinion data reaching at least as far back as the 1980s \citep[e.g.,][]{bartels_2002,jerit2012partisan}. As such, the idea of large partisan knowledge gaps---differences in the types of information that Democrats and Republicans know---has become axiomatic in the political science. Indeed, as \citet{bullocketal_2015} note, conventional wisdom in the discipline that ``a persistent pattern in American public opinion is the presence of large differences between Democrats and Republicans in statements of factual beliefs'' (520). Everyday Americans seem to be catching on as well. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2018 demonstated that nearly eight in ten Americans believe that Democrats and Republicans not only disagree on plans and policies, but on facts as well \citep{pew2018disagree}. 

Large knowledge gaps stemming from partisan biases are concerning. Just as high levels of political knowledge can lead to better citizenship, mass disagreement politically consequential facts can impede democratic governance and representation. Theories of retrospective accountability hinge citizens' ability to judge how well incumbents have performed in office  \citep{fiorina1981retrospective,Key1966,kramer_1971}. If Republicans and Democrats rely upon different sets of facts to make these judgments, elected officials have weaker incentives to work for their constituents. Partisan disagreement about basic facts also reduces the possibility of meaningful dialogue. If Republicans and Democrats disagree about how the economy is doing, a discussion about policies for improving the economy is unlikely to follow. 

Given the long shadow that these gaps cast on the health of democracy, understanding how often and to what extent partisans differ in their knowledge of political facts is vital. To study the issue, we assembled a large dataset of partisan-relevant knowledge items. To do so, we made use of data from three prominent studies on the nature and pervasiveness of partisan knowledge gaps \citep{bullocketal_2015,jerit2012partisan,prior2015you}. We find that partisan knowledge gaps are highly variable, and that large differences in what Democrats and Republicans believe are less common than conventional wisdom suggests. In fact, fewer than one in three partisan knowledge gaps are larger than ten percentage points. In addition, nearly one in three partisan knowledge gaps are in the ``wrong'' direction, that is, partisans know less party-congenial information than their opponents. In addition, more than half of the gaps in the expected direction are not statistically significant at conventional levels, despite large sample sizes. On the whole, the average knowledge gap between Democrats and Republicans is six percentage points.

We attempt to reconcile these findings with the conventional wisdom that partisan knowledge gaps are large and pervasive. We find little evidence that features of question wording systematically affect the size of such gaps; only questions that ask about topics about which there is significant misinformation or questions that are asked during presidential election campaigns appear to meaningfully influence the size of such gaps. We do, find, however, that the wording of response options matters. Specifically, we find that much of the conventional wisdom surrounding the ubiquity and size of knowledge gaps can be traced to  \citet{anes_gen} (ANES) questions, which include vague response options that encourage respondents to interpret meaning based on their own partisan biases. In a companion paper, using an original experiment, we demonstrate that vague response options of this type can produce partisan knowledge gaps \textit{even when} Democrats and Republicans know the answer \citep{roush_2021}. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that partisan knowledge gaps---when they do exist---are more an artifact of ``partisan cheerleading'' \citep{bullocketal_2015,prior2015you} or motivated guessing than a reflection of genuine differences in knowledge.


\section*{Partisan Learning and Political Knowledge}

During Bill Clinton's first term as president, the US budget deficit shrunk from \$255 billion to \$22 billion. Near the end of 1996, when the ANES asked a representative sample of Americans whether the budget deficit had decreased, increased, or remained the same over the past four years, far fewer Republicans than Democrats knew that the deficit had declined. While 39\% of Democrats correctly identified that the budget deficit had decreased, only 25\% of Republicans did the same \citep[280]{achen2016democracy}.

Such large discrepancies are considered neither anomalous nor unexpected. Our understanding of how partisan bias influences information processing suggests that there are good reasons to expect partisan knowledge gaps to be large and ubiquitous. The psychological processes underlying the development of knowledge gaps is similar to those that produce partisan differences in attitudes and evaluations on a wide variety of subjects. When people encounter information that conflicts with their predispositions, they experience cognitive discomfort, which they try to minimize by employing a variety of defense mechanisms \citep[e.g.,][]{abelson1959modes,festinger1962theory}. Specifically, they avoid exposing themselves to sources that provide them with uncongenial information, distrust such information when they do come across it, and do not work as hard to retain it \citep{bartels_2002, jerit2012partisan, lodgetaber_2013}. Partisanship helps reduce cognitive discomfort by acting as a ``perceptual screen,'' filtering in congenial facts that comport with an individual's partisan worldview while filtering out those that challenge it \citep{campbell1960, Zaller1992}. As a result, the theory goes, Democrats and Republicans come to ``know'' different types of information and consequently vary in their ability to answer political knowledge questions correctly.

That being said, recent scholarship has provided reasons to doubt that these knowledge gaps are as frequent and sizable as commonly believed. For one,  \citet{bullocketal_2015} and \citet{prior2015you} demonstrate that partisan gaps in factual beliefs about politics are often the product of motivated responding. ``Partisan cheerleading'' arises when partisans want to send a message to either pollsters or the public at large about the strength or righteousness of their preferred party's stance on a particular matter \citep{huber_yair_2018}. As a result, what may look like differences in political knowledge among partisans may be more a consequence of respondents providing party-congenial responses rather than expressing what they genuinely know. \citet{bullocketal_2015} and \citet{prior2015you} show that these partisan gaps can be reduced by shifting respondents' directional motives to accuracy motives via small monetary incentives for correct answers. More recently, \citet{huber_yair_2018} also showed that partisan gaps shrink when survey respondents are given the opportunity to cheerlead prior to answering other questions. Taken together, these studies suggest that the concern that Democrats and Republicans are truly drawing on differential bases of political knowledge may be overblown.

Secondly, a more critical examination of the processes thought to underlie the production of knowledge gaps suggests that genuine differences in knowledge between Democrats and Republicans should be smaller. According to the theory of selective exposure, Democrats and Republicans consume different media sources, thereby learning and retaining different facts that are reflected in reported knowledge of political information \citep[e.g.,][]{Stroud2008,stroud_2010}. In reality, however, most people consume very little political news \citep{Prior2007,flaxmanetal_2016}, and the news that they do consume is relatively ideologically balanced \citep{flaxmanetal_2016,garzetal_2018,gentzkowshapiro_2011,guess_2020}. There is little reason, therefore, to believe that knowledge gaps emerge as a result of partisans simply tuning into different sources. Regardless of where partisans get their information, evidence shows that they do learn facts in a motivated fashion \citep{hill_2017,jerit2012partisan,khanna2018motivated}---but the effects are modest, and people exhibit little partisan bias in their recall of information \citep{khanna2018motivated}. Other scholars have pointed out that Democrats and Republicans respond to current events in a similar fashion, bringing into question the existence of motivated learning in the first place \citep{gerber_annual_review,kernell_2019}. Therefore, the conventional wisdom regarding the individual-level mechanisms thought to produce large knowledge gaps may be flawed.

Given what scholars know about the nature of partisan survey response, news consumption, and knowledge recall, there are good reasons to doubt that partisan knowledge gaps are as large, ubiquitous, and normatively troubling as expected. That being said, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the nature and frequency of such partisan differences outside of experimental contexts. Indeed, as \citet{bullocklenz_2019} note in their review of partisan bias in surveys, ``despite burgeoning interest in partisan differences [in responses to factual questions about politics], there have been few attempts to generalize about the size of these differences'' (330).  In the remainder of this paper, we attempt to do just that.

\section*{Data and Research Design}

We surveyed 1,253 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) on July 9th, 2017. We randomly assigned respondents to one of five branches—Real World (RW),
Iron Pyrite Standard (IP), Fewer Substantive Responses (FSR), 14k Gold Standard (14k), and the 24k Gold Standard (24k). In each condition respondents answered 9 misinformation items, ranging from citizenship and religion of Obama to whether global warming is happening or not. (The exact question
wording for each of the items is presented in Appendix C.) Respondents assigned to RW and IP saw a simple preface: ``Now here are some questions about what you may know about politics and public affairs,'' while in all the other conditions, they were reassured that it is ok to not know answers to these questions and to commit to not looking up answers or asking anyone and to mark don't know when they don’t know. (Again, see Appendix C for the specific wording.)
The RW condition reflects the real-world standards most closely--it does not feature a `Don't Know', it often features social proof about the incorrect answer, for instance, ``Some people believe Barack Obama was not born in the United States, but was born in another country'' on a question about where Mr. Obama was born, and some neutral information about the topic, like ``According to the Constitution, American presidents must be `natural born citizens''' on the birthplace question, that may encourage the ignorant to take a guess.

The Iron Pyrite Standard (or the Fool's Gold Standard) reflects the standard likely to inflate the number of incorrect responses the most. It never includes the 'Don't Know,' it always includes neutral information that encourages people to take a guess, and it also includes social proof about the incorrect answer.

The FSR standard adds a `Don't Know’ and removes from the question stem any neutral information that is likely to cause people to offer a substantive response when they don't know. The 14k gold standard gives us the best version of the multiple-choice question while maintaining commensurability with other items. The 14k, vis-a-vis FSR removes social proof from the stem as well.

The 24k standard asks respondents to rate the claim on a 0 to 10 scale going from `definitely false' to `definitely true.' The question is inspired by other attempts to take account of confidence in distinguishing misinformation from incorrect responses stemming from processes like inference, unlucky guessing, and such (see, for instance, Pasek et al. 2015).

Partisan Cues
The aim of the study is to present experimental evidence about effect of partisan cues in the question stem on responses by partisans. For the purpose of the study, we examine closed-ended items asking about policy-relevant facts or objective performance, particularly those items stirring affective consistency, stereotyping, or both.  In the first case, items whose correct response option one side or the other would like to disbelieve, or at least one of whose incorrect response options one side or the other would like to believe, or both; in the second case items whose correct response option defies stereotype, or at least one of whose incorrect response options conforms to stereotype, or both.  

For exploring the research question, we exploit two datasets – a national survey conducted by YouGov, and a telephone survey of a random sample of adults in Texas and. The YouGov survey interviewed 2000 respondents between July 10th and 12th, 2012.  In Texas, a total of 1003 interviews were conducted between September 10th and 21st, 2012. 
In the YouGov survey, respondents were randomly assigned to factual questions with either a Republican or Democratic cue in the stem. In a question about whether “since 2010 midterm elections, the unemployment rate [had] gone up, down, or remained the same, or couldn’t you say?”, we inserted either the phrase “when Republicans regained control of the U.S. Congress” or “when Democrats retained control of the Senate” right after the first phrase. We employed a similar manipulation for the question on budget deficit, asking how the budget deficit had fared “since the 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans regained control of the U.S. Congress (or “when Democrats retained control of the Senate”), has the budget deficit gone up, gone down, remained the same, or couldn’t you say?”
In the Texas survey, we added another condition to the above design – no partisan cue in the stem. So a third of the respondents were assigned to a question that simply read, “since the 2010 midterm elections, has the unemployment rate gone up, gone down, or remained the same?  Or couldn’t you say?”. For the second question we changed our design to – no partisan cue, Democratic cue, and Democratic cue plus the following introduction “based on what you have heard”. The question read, “since January 2009, have federal taxes increased, decreased, or remained the same or couldn’t you say?”. The second version gave respondents a Democratic cue by changing the initial part of the sentence; the question now read, “Since Barack Obama took office….”.  The third version prepended a cue designed to encourage guessing to the second version; the version read, “Based on what you have heard, since Barack Obama took office, …”

\end{figure}
\end{center}

We start with data from the YouGov survey that manipulated partisan cues in the stem. To assess how partisan references in the question stem cuing accountability affect responses by partisans, we ran an ordered logit, regressing the response on the budget deficit and unemployment question on partisan identification, partisan cue, and interaction between partisan identification and the cue. As expected, Republicans are much likely than Democrats to say that the unemployment rate and budget deficit are going up (Unemployment: b = 1.14, p < .001; Budget Deficit: b = 2.02, p < .001; see Table 3). Presumably this is a consequence of the president (a Democrat) being held responsible for unemployment rate and budget deficit. When the question stem highlights Republicans in position of responsibility, versus the Democrats, Republicans are much less likely to say that the unemployment rate has gone up since 2010 (b = -1.13, p < .001). We obtain almost identical, only stronger, findings for budget deficit, with question stem highlighting Republican responsibility, vis-a-vis Democratic responsibility, causing Republicans to become less likely to report that the budget deficit is going up. This isn’t a Republican phenomenon for if we split the results by party, we see opposing movement among Democrats and Republicans due to the question stem. The results from the experiment suggest that a number of respondents are using available cues to answer the question, than stored cognitions about the unemployment rate and the budget deficit. 

Next we move to data from the Texas survey which in addition to including partisan cues in the question stem also had a condition in which questions had no partisan cues. With this ``control'' condition, we can assess how addition of partisan cues changes how partisans respond to these questions. We once again ran an ordered logit predicting responses to the knowledge questions using partisanship, experimental conditions and interaction between experimental conditions and partisanship. Once again we see that Republicans are likelier to report, vis-a-vis Democrats, that the unemployment rate and taxes have gone up since 2010 elections (Unemployment: b = 1.24, p < .001;  Tax rates: b= 1.77, p < .001; see Table 4). Compared to the no cue condition, addition of a Republican responsibility cue makes Republicans much less likelier to report that unemployment is going up (b = -1.00, p < .05). Reverse happens with the Democratic cue, as Republicans become more likely to say that the unemployment rate has gone up (b= .98, p < .05). Democratic cue on taxes doesn't do as much vis-a-vis no-cue but solicitation of opinion makes Republicans much more likely to reports that taxes have gone up (b = .86; p < .05). In all, we have fair evidence that uninformed partisans use partisan cues to either infer incorrectly, or respond in a manner that reflects well on their partisan identity. 

\section*{Discussion and Conclusion}

Our results clarify our understanding of partisan knowledge gaps in important ways. First, partisan knowledge gaps are less ubiquitous than what conventional wisdom in political science suggests. For three in ten items, partisans either know \textit{less} party-congenial information or \textit{more} party-\textit{un}congenial information than their opponents. Among gaps occurring in the correct direction, we can only be certain that Democrats and Republicans actually differ from one another in their factual understanding of politics less than half the time. Secondly, the average knowledge gap in our data is small, with a mean gap of six percentage points and a median gap of about three percentage points. Third, many question features like the number of response options or question wording weakly predict the size of partisan knowledge gaps; instead, it is question difficulty and the \textit{content} of response options that influence the size of the gap.

If partisan gaps are small on average and difficult to predict based on question wording, why does the common wisdom that Democrats and Republicans differ substantially in political knowledge persist? One explanation may be that the knowledge items in our dataset are a not a representative set of relevant cognitions that partisans have. It may well be that the knowledge gaps are larger on partisan-relevant facts that are not asked about in the studies described above. To what degree this is so, we cannot say, except to note that the general bias is to ``hunt where the ducks are.'' That is, in at least two of our studies \citep{bullocketal_2015, prior2015you}, expert political scientists constructed knowledge questions that they reasonably believed \textit{a priori} would produce large partisan gaps; in the case of \citet{jerit2012partisan}, the authors built a dataset of knowledge questions that they believed carried a partisan implication (in other words, in which they expected knowledge gaps between Democrats and Republicans to occur). The fact that statistically significant, ``positive'' knowledge gaps only emerge on about half of the items from these studies suggests that partisan knowledge gaps are less common even when looking in the most obvious place. 

A potentially more satisfying explanation for this discrepancy is that such conventional wisdom is largely based on studies using data from the \citet{anes_gen}. Much of the literature on partisan knowledge gaps has built upon \citet{bartels_2002}, who was the first to write about these differences \citep{bullocklenz_2019}. For example, using the ANES data, \citet{bartels_2002} discovered that Democrats and Republicans reported different beliefs on a variety of objective facts---such as how inflation and unemployment changed over the previous eight years---while Ronald Reagan was president. In 1988, the estimated differences between Democrats and Republicans on knowledge questions ranged from approximately 12 to 36 percentage points, depending on the question.\footnote{These figures have been rescaled in percentage point terms. \citeapos{bartels_2002}  original calculation is that ``the estimated differences between Democrats and Republicans rang[e] from .249 to .715 on the -1 to +1 scales'' (137).} These kinds of questions with imprecise response options---which ask about respondents' \textit{assessment} of politically relevant facts rather than their actual \textit{knowledge} of such facts---are one of the most likely source of large partisan knowledge gaps. The fact that questions with imprecise response options are commonplace on one of the biggest publicly-available sources of survey data likely helps perpetuate the idea that Democrats and Republicans approach the political world with entirely different information. 

Based on our results here, we suspect that the vast majority of partisan gaps---when they do appear---are more likely to be a product of motivated responding than of partisans simply knowing different things (\citeauthor{bisgaard_slothuus_2018} \citeyear{bisgaard_slothuus_2018}; \citeauthor {bullocketal_2015} \citeyear{bullocketal_2015}; \citeauthor{prior2015you} \citeyear{prior2015you}; \citeauthor{schaffner_luks} \citeyear{schaffner_luks}; but see \citeauthor{berinsky_2017} \citeyear{berinsky_2017} and \citeauthor{peterson_iyengar_forth} \citeyear{peterson_iyengar_forth}). None of this is to say that partisan bias does not play a role in shaping how Democrats and Republicans interpret what they know; there is ample evidence to suggest that it does \citep[e.g.,][]{bisgaard2015bias, gainesetal_2007, khanna2018motivated}. Nor should the small size of the average gap prevent us from noting that on many of the questions, a majority of partisans on both sides of the aisle were either ignorant or misinformed about the facts: the average proportion of Republicans and Democrats who provided correct answers to these knowledge questions is about 42\% each. 

While this is certainly troubling for those who view political knowledge as an essential component of democratic citizenship, there is some reason for optimism. When it comes to knowledge of political facts, more often than not, there do not appear to be large imbalances between what Democrats and Republicans know. When partisan differences do emerge, we suspect that they are often more a product of biased interpretation of survey questions rather than of differential stores of knowledge. This suggests that even in a polarized political context, most Democrats and Republicans can use the same information to make collective judgments about whether to reward or punish elected officials based on performance---whether they want to, of course, is another question.
