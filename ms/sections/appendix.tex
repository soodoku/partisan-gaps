\section{Item Text for the MTurk Study}\label{si:mturk}

\textbf{Preface for Different Conditions}

\textbf{RW, IP}\newline
Now here are some questions about what you may know about politics and public affairs.

\textbf{FSR, 14k, 24k}\newline
Now here are some questions about what you may know about politics and public affairs.
We are interested in measuring what people currently know and can recall on their own and are
just as interested in what people don't know as in what they do know. So we'd like your
agreement to just say ``don't know'' if you don't know the answer—without looking anything up
or talking with anyone about it.

\textbf{Item Text}
\textbf{24k}\newline
Now here are a series of statements. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means definitely false,
10 means definitely true, and 5 is exactly in the middle, how definitely true or false is
each statement?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Barack Obama was born in the US (T)
	\item  Barack Obama is a Muslim (F)
	\item  The Affordable Care Act gives illegal immigrants financial help to buy health insurance (F)
	\item  The Affordable Care Act does not create government panels to make decisions about end-of-life care (T)
	\item  Temperatures around the world are increasing because of human activity, like burning coal and gasoline (T)
	\item  Most climate scientists believe that global warming is not occurring (F)
	\item  In the 2016 presidential election, President Trump won the majority of the legally cast votes (F)
	\item  The vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) causes autism in children. (F)
	\item  Since 2012, the annual federal budget deficit has increased. (T)

\section{Item Text for the Second MTurk Study}\label{si:mturk2}


The second Amazon MTurk survey was fielded in April 2017 and had 1,059 participants. In this survey we made use of new questions and probes to examine the effect of question design on (partisan) knowledge. We asked the participants four questions about the Affordable Care Act (2), the effect of greenhouse gases (1), and Donald Trump's recent executive order on immigration (1).

\textbf{Rules for Coding Open Ended Questions}\newline

In coding open-ended responses, all misspellings, modifications, synonyms, and identifiable abbreviations of a word were fully credited.


\noindent
\textbf{Honesty Pledge}

At the beginning of the survey, a random two-thirds of the respondents were asked to commit to not look up the answers or to ask anyone about the answers. Rest one-third of the participants didn’t see any message at the start.


\noindent
\textbf{Photo Vs. Text}

Individuals were asked knowledge questions about domestic and international political leaders. These leaders were presented to the participants either as a photo (asking for name or position) or they saw the name as text (asking for the position).

\noindent
The preamble for the two treatments were:

\begin{description}
\item[Photo:] Here’s a set of photos. For each photo, can you tell me what position he or she holds? If you don’t know, don’t worry about it. Just leave the space blank, and move on to the next person. What position does this person hold?
\item[Text:] Here’s a list of names. For each name, can you tell me what position that person holds? If you don’t know, don’t worry about it. Just leave the space blank, and move on to the next person. What position does this person hold?
\end{description}


\begin{itemize}
\item Mitch McConnell
\begin{itemize}
\item  OE: (Senate OR majority) AND (leader OR chief OR head OR president OR chair OR whip)
\end{itemize}
\item Chuck Schumer
\begin{itemize}
\item  OE: (Senate OR minority) AND (leader OR in charge)
\end{itemize}
\item Angela Merkel
\begin{itemize}
\item OE: German AND (President OR Leader OR Prime Minister OR Chancellor OR Premier AND Ruler AND charge)
\end{itemize}
\item Vladimir Putin
\begin{itemize}
\item OE: Russia AND (President OR Leader OR Head OR Chancellor OR Premier OR Prime Minister)
\end{itemize}
\item John Roberts
\begin{itemize}
\item OE: Chief AND Justice
\end{itemize}
\item Nancy Pelosi
\begin{itemize}
\item OE: Minority AND Leade
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{comment}

One half of the survey respondents got a conventional closed-ended item with five options including the opportunity to mark Don’t know. The other half of the respondents had to assess the truth of statements on a scale from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10).


\begin{description}
	\item[1.] Does the Affordable Care Act ...?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  CE: Provide coverage for people who are currently in the country illegally, Replace private health insurance with a ``single payer system'', \textbf{Increase the Medicare payroll tax for upper-income Americans}, Reimburse routine mammograms only for women older than 50, Don’t know (5)
		\item  Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don’t know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:aca1}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[2.] Are greenhouse gases ...?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CE: A cause of respiratory problems, A cause of for lung cancer, Damaging the ozone layer, \textbf{A cause of rising sea levels}, or Don’t know
		\item Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don’t know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:gg1}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[3.] And does the Affordable Care Act ...?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CE: Create government panels to make end-of-life decisions for people on Medicare, Replace Medicare with a ``public option'', \textbf{Limit future increases in payments to Medicare providers}, Cut benefits to existing Medicare patients, Don’t know
		\item Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don’t know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:aca2}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[4.] Does President Trump’s most recent executive order on immigration ...?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  CE: Subject immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to deportation, Strip immigrants from countries supporting terrorism of their green cards, Strip immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries of their green cards, \textbf{Temporarily ban immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries}, Don’t know
		\item  Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don’t know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:eo1}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

If the close-ended questions 3 and 4 were not answered with Don’t know the respondents received one of two a follow- up question:
\begin{itemize}
	\item OE: What made you choose that response?
	\item CE: What made you choose that response? I asked someone I know, I looked it up, I’ve read, seen, or heard that, It makes me feel good to think that, It makes sense, in view of other things I know, I just thought I’d take a shot

\textbf{Inference}

The following close-ended two deficit related questions were presented to all survey participants.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item During the time Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit: \textbf{Increased}, Remained about the same, Decreased, Don’t Know
	\item During the time George W. Bush was president, the federal deficit: \textbf{Increased}, Remained about the same, Decreased, Don’t Know
\end{enumerate}

Both questions were followed by a probe. For one half of the respondents this probe was open and for the other one the probe was closed.
\begin{itemize}
	\item OE: What made you choose that response?
	\item CE: What made you choose that response? I asked someone I know, I looked it up, I’ve read, seen, or heard that, It makes me feel good to think that, It makes sense, in view of other things I know, I just thought I’d take a shot
\end{itemize}
