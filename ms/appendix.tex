\section{Item Text for MTurk 1}\label{si:mturk1}
For exposition, we present the conditions using different terms in the main body (see \cref{tab:conditions}). The following shows how our terminologies for conditions map to the MTurk questionnaires.

\textbf{Preface for Different Conditions}

\textbf{RW, IP}\newline
Now here are some questions about what you may know about politics and public affairs.

\textbf{FSR, IMC, CCD}\newline
Now here are some questions about what you may know about politics and public affairs.
We are interested in measuring what people currently know and can recall on their own and are just as interested in what people don't know as in what they do know. So we'd like your agreement to just say ``don't know'' if you don't know the answer—without looking anything up or talking with anyone about it.

\textbf{Item Text}
\textbf{CCD}\newline
Now here are a series of statements. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means definitely false, 10 means definitely true, and 5 is exactly in the middle, how definitely true or false is each statement?

	\item Barack Obama was born in the US (T)
	\item  Barack Obama is a Muslim (F)

\section{Item Text for MTurk 2}\label{si:mturk2}

The second Amazon MTurk survey was fielded in April 2017 and had 1,059 participants. In this survey, we made use of new questions and probes to examine the effect of question design on (partisan) knowledge. We asked the participants four questions about the Affordable Care Act (2), the effect of greenhouse gases (1), and Donald Trump's recent executive order on immigration (1).

One-half of the survey respondents got a conventional closed-ended item with five options including the opportunity to mark Don’t know. The other half of the respondents had to assess the truth of statements on a scale from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10).

\begin{description}
\item[1.] Does the Affordable Care Act ...?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  CE: Provide coverage for people who are currently in the country illegally, Replace private health insurance with a ``single-payer system'', \textbf{Increase the Medicare payroll tax for upper-income Americans}, Reimburse routine mammograms only for women older than 50, Don’t know (5)
    \item  Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don't know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:aca1}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[2.] Are greenhouse gases ...?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item CE: A cause of respiratory problems, A cause of lung cancer, Damaging the ozone layer, \textbf{A cause of rising sea levels}, or Don't know
  \item Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don't know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:gg1}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[3.] And does the Affordable Care Act ...?
    \begin{itemize}
  \item CE: Create government panels to make end-of-life decisions for people on Medicare, Replace Medicare with a ``public option'', \textbf{Limit future increases in payments to Medicare providers}, Cut benefits to existing Medicare patients, Don’t know
  \item Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don't know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:aca2}.
    \end{itemize}
        \item[4.] Does President Trump’s most recent executive order on immigration ...?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  CE: Subject immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to deportation, Strip immigrants from countries supporting terrorism of their green cards, Strip immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries of their green cards, \textbf{Temporarily ban immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries}, Don’t know
    \item  Scale: Rating each response option above from definitely false (0) to definitely true (10). Don't know was not included. See Figure \ref{fig:eo1}.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{description}

If the close-ended questions 3 and 4 were not answered with Don’t know the respondents received one of two follow-up questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item OE: What made you choose that response?
 \item CE: What made you choose that response? I asked someone I know, I looked it up, I've read, seen, or heard that, It makes me feel good to think that, It makes sense, in view of other things I know, I just thought I’d take a shot

\section{Proportion Correct across Questions}

Table \ref{tab:prop_correct} shows the proportion of correct answers across the Affordable Care Act questions (ACA and ACA2), the Greenhouse Gas question, and the question about Donald Trump's executive order. We report the proportion correct for closed questions in the multiple-choice format and the relative scoring at the thresholds of 8 and 10. For the relative scoring to code an answer as correct the confidence for the correct answer had to be 8 (or 10), the scoring had to be the maximum number given, it had to be unique, and incorrect answers were not allowed to be scored higher than 2 (or 0).
